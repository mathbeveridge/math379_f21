 Let <m>T(n,k)</m> be the number of labeled forests on <m>[n]</m> with <m>k</m> components such that the vertices in <m>[k]</m> are all in different tree components.




			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that <m>T(4,2)=8</m> by enumerating all the forests on 4 vertices with 2 trees in which vertex 1 and vertex 2 are in different trees.

 Prove the recurrence relation
<me>
T(n,k) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-k} {n - k \choose i} T(n-1, k-1+i) \qquad \mbox{where } 1 \leq k \leq n
</me>
where <m>T(0,0)=1</m> and <m>T(n,0)=0</m> for <m>n\geq 1</m>. (Hint: treat vertex 1 as special.)

 We obtain the <em>ordered degree sequence</em> of a graph by arranging the degrees in non-increasing order (from largest to smallest). In this problem, you will find the number of possible ordered degree sequences for a tree.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let  <m>d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n</m> be an ordered degree sequence of a tree.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
  Prove that <m>\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i = 2n-2</m>.



					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
  Prove that <m>d_{n-2} = d_{n-1}= 1</m> by contradiction. That is, prove that if one of these numbers is greater than 1, then part (i) does not hold.


					</p>
				</li>

 We can use induction on <m>n \geq 2</m> to prove that if (i) and (ii) hold, then there is a tree with the given ordered degree sequence. The statement is true for <m>n=2</m>, and we assume it is true for all such sequences of length <m>n-1</m>. Consider a sequence <m>d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n</m> satisfying (i) and (ii). Find the last <m>d_i &gt; 1</m>. Remove <m>d_n</m> from the sequence and replace <m>d_i</m> with <m>d_i-1</m>. Explain why (i) and (ii) hold for the resulting sequence of length <m>n-1</m>. Use this fact to create a tree with degree sequence <m>d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n</m>.


					</p>

 Given our characterization (i) and (ii) for ordered degree sequences for trees, how many are there?

			</p><p>
We give three different formulas, all equivalent.
