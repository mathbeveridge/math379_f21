	<title>Average Number of Cycles in a Permutation</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>





Let <m>A(n)</m> be the average number of cycles in an <m>n</m>-permutation. The goal of this activity is to prove that
<me>
A(n) =  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}.
</me>
Here, <m>\displaystyle{H(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}}</m> is the <m>n</m>th Harmonic number, which is another <em>very</em> important sequence in mathematics.


			</p><p>

Let <m>c(n)</m> denote the total number of cycles in all <m>n</m>-permutations.

			<statement>
				<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Prove that <m>\displaystyle{c(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n k \cdot c(n,k)}</m>.



<solution>
<p>
The LHS is the total number of cycles in all <m>n</m>-permutations.


Consider the <m>k</m>th term of the RHS:
\[
\underbrace{c(n,k)}_{\begin{array}{c}\mbox{# permutations} \\ \mbox{with <m>k</m> cycles} \end{array}} \cdot
\underbrace{k}_{\begin{array}{c}\mbox{# cycles in such} \\ \mbox{a permutation} \end{array}}
\]
We sum over <m>1 \leq k \leq n</m> to get all possibilities.

 Prove that <m>\displaystyle{A(n) = \frac{c(n)}{n!}}</m>.



<solution>

Dividing <m>c(n)</m> by the total number of permutations yields <m>A(n)</m>.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use a graph to explain why <m>H(n)</m> is a pretty good approximation for
<m>\int_1^n \frac{1}{x} dx</m>. What function does this integral represent?


<solution>
<p>

			<image width="60%" xml:id="fig-img-perm-num-cycles0" source="images/int-1-over-x.png" />

The integral <m>\int_1^n \frac{1}{x} dx</m> can be approximated by the sum
<m>1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots \frac{1}{n}</m> as shown in the above graph.


			</p><p>

Evaluating this integral gives <m>\int_1^n \frac{1}{x} dx = \log (n) - \log (1) = \log n</m> where <m>\log(x)</m> is the natural logarithm of <m>x</m>.

 Interpret the meaning of
<m>A(n) =  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}</m>
using your approximate function.



<solution>
<p>

The average number of cycles in an <m>n</m>-permutation is approximately <m>\log n</m>.

			<title>A recurrence for <m>c(n)</m></title>
			<idx><h>A recurrence for <m>c(n)</m></h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>

We will prove the recurrence
<me>
c(n) = n \cdot c(n-1) + (n-1)!
</me>
As usual, we will treat element <m>n</m> as special. Given an <m>n</m>-permutation <m>f \in S_n</m>, what happens when we remove element <m>n</m>? There are two cases

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Suppose that <m>n</m> was in a cycle by itself. Prove that the total number of <em>cycles</em> in such  permutations is <m>c(n-1) + (n-1)!</m>.

<solution>
<p>

When <m>n</m> is in a cycle by itself, the permutation naturally corresponds to an <m>(n-1)</m>-permutation. There are <m>c(n-1)</m> cycles in all such permutations. We add <m>(n-1)!</m> to account for final the cycle containing <m>n</m> because there are <m>(n-1)!</m> permutations of <m>[n-1]</m>.

</p>
</solution>


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Suppose that <m>n</m> was <em>not</em> in a cycle by itself. Prove that the total number of <em>cycles</em> in such  permutations is <m>(n-1) \cdot c(n-1)</m>.


<solution>
<p>

Removing <m>n</m> from the permutation gives an <m>(n-1)</m>-permutation with the same number of cycles. We obtain each <m>(n-1)</m> cycle in <m>n-1</m> ways, since the element <m>n</m> can be placed before any element of the <m>(n-1)</m>-permutation (and within the same cycle as that element).

</p>
</solution>

				</li>
			</ol>
Putting together the answers from questions 2 and 3, we find that
<me>
c(n) =  \Big( c(n-1) + (n-1)!  \Big)+ (n-1) \cdot c(n-1) = n \cdot c(n-1) + (n-1)!
</me>
as claimed at the start of the problem.

			<statement>
				<p>
Starting with the formula in problem 1(b) and the recurrence in problem 2, prove that
<me>
A(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}.
</me>

<solution>
<p>
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
c(n) &amp;=&amp; n c(n-1) + (n-1)! \\
\frac{c(n)}{n!} &amp;=&amp; \frac{n c(n-1)}{n!} + \frac{(n-1)!}{n!} \\
A(n) &amp;=&amp; A(n-1) + \frac{1}{n} \\
\end{array}
</me>
Now, we know that <m>A(1)=1</m> because there is a unique <m>1</m>-permutation and it has one cycle. From the recurrence it is easy to see that <m>A(2) = 1 + 1/2</m> and <m>A(3) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3</m>. In general, we have
<m>A(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n 1/i</m>.
