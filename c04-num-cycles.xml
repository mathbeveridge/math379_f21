	<title>Average Number of Cycles in a Permutation</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>





Let <m>A(n)</m> be the average number of cycles in an <m>n</m>-permutation. The goal of this activity is to prove that
<me>
A(n) =  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}.
</me>
Here, <m>\displaystyle{H(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}}</m> is the <m>n</m>th Harmonic number, which is another <em>very</em> important sequence in mathematics.


			</p><p>

Let <m>c(n)</m> denote the total number of cycles in all <m>n</m>-permutations.

We will prove the recurrence
<me>
c(n) = n \cdot c(n-1) + (n-1)!
</me>
As usual, we will treat element <m>n</m> as special. Given an <m>n</m>-permutation <m>f \in S_n</m>, what happens when we remove element <m>n</m>? There are two cases

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Suppose that <m>n</m> was in a cycle by itself. Prove that the total number of {\bf{cycles}} in such  permutations is <m>c(n-1) + (n-1)!</m>.



					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Suppose that <m>n</m> was <em>not</em> in a cycle by itself. Prove that the total number of {\bf{cycles}} in such  permutations is <m>(n-1) \cdot c(n-1)</m>.



					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
Putting together the answers from questions 2 and 3, we find that
<me>
c(n) =  \Big( c(n-1) + (n-1)!  \Big)+ (n-1) \cdot c(n-1) = n \cdot c(n-1) + (n-1)!
</me>
as claimed at the start of the problem.


\item[5.]  \myname{The main result}
Starting with the formula in problem 1(b) and the recurrence in problem 2, prove that
<me>
A(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}.
