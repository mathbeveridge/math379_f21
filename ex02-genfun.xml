<em>Pro Tip.</em>
When solving recurrences using generating functions, it is nice to know that you have the right answer. So you should get into the habit of checking along the way!

			</p><p>

<em> Before:</em> Calculate the first few <m>a_n</m> using the recurrence. Mathematica is a great tool for this! For example, the following code will print out the first terms of the sequence <m>a_0 = 3</m>, <m>a_1 = 5</m>, <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + 4</m>.
<cd>
myseq[0] = 3
myseq[1] = 5
myseq[n_] := 2 myseq[n-1] + myseq[n-2] + 4
Table[myseq[k], {k,0,5}]
</cd>

			</p><p>

<em> During:</em> Once you have a candidate generating function, you can use the <c>Series[]</c> function in Mathematica to find the first terms of its Taylor series. These values should match the values above (NOTE: if you are using an exponential generating function, then you must divide these values by n!)

			</p><p>

<em> After</em>: Once you have a simple formula for the sequence, you can calculate the first few values and compare once again. Mathematica is your friend.

 We consider two sports with tricky scoring rules.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 American Football is played on a rectangular field between two teams. The field is 100 yards long, with a ten yard end zone at each end, each of which has a set of goalposts. The game is played with a single ball in the shape of a prolate spheroid.
			<image width="60%" xml:id="fig-img-counting-exercise0" source="images/football.jpg" />
The offensive team tries to advance the ball down the field. While on offense (in possession of the ball), a team can score in four ways
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 kicking a field goal (3 points) by kicking the ball through the goalposts in the opposing team's end zone;
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 scoring a touchdown (6 points) by advancing the ball across the length of the field and into the opposing team's end zone;
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 scoring a touchdown plus extra point (7 points) by following up this touchdown by kicking the ball through the goalposts; and
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 scoring a touchdown plus two-point conversion (8 points) by following up this touchdown with another successful offensive scoring play.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
While on defense (not in possession of the ball), a team can score in one way:
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 scoring a safety (2 points) by tackling the ball carrier (on the opposing team) in his own endzone.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
The game is played for sixty minutes.
Use the product principle for generating functions to find a concise formula for <m>F(x)</m>, the generating function for the number of ways to to score <m>n</m> points in a football game.

 Quidditch is played on an oval pitch, five hundred feet long. At each end, there are three hooped goal posts of different heights, surrounded by a scoring area. The game is played with four bewitched flying spherical balls: two Bludgers, one Quaffle and one Snitch.
			<image width="70%" xml:id="fig-img-counting-exercise1" source="images/quidditch.jpg" />
Two teams of wizards on flying broomsticks zip around the pitch trying to score points. This can be done in two ways.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Sending the Quaffle through any of the three goal hoops in the appropriate scoring area (10 points); and
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Capturing the Snitch (150 points).
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
The game ends when the Snitch is caught, or an agreement is reached between the captains of both teams.
Use the product principle for generating functions to find a concise formula for <m>Q(x)</m>, the generating function for the number of ways to to score <m>n</m> points in a Quidditch game.

 Use generating functions to find an explicit formula for <m>b_n</m> if <m>b_0=3</m> and <m>b_1=7</m> and <m>b_n = 3 b_{n-1} - 2 b_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>.

 Consider the Fibonacci recurrence <m>f_0=0</m>, <m>f_1=1</m> and <m>f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2.</m>
Prove that the ordinary generating function of this sequence is
<m></m>F(x) = \frac{x}{1-x-x^2}.<m></m>
You <em>do not</em> need to find an explicit formula for <m>f_n</m>.

 Consider the recurrence <m>a_0=1</m>, <m>a_1=2</m>, and <m>a_n =  na_{n-1} + n(n-1) a_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Find the <em>exponential</em> generating function <m>A(x)</m> for this sequence.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Compare <m>A(x)</m> to <m>F(x)</m> from the previous problem. From this find a formula for <m>a_n</m> as a function of Fibonacci numbers <m>f_k</m>. In other words, you will get an expression for <m>a_n</m> that includes term(s) of the form <m>f_k</m>. (Note: the fact that <m>f_0=0</m> will be helpful as you change from functions back to power series.)

  A coin pyramid is an arrangement of n coins in rows such that
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Coins in each row form a contiguous block
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 For <m>k&gt;1</m>, coins in the <m>k</m>th row touch exactly 2 coins from the row beneath it.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

Here is an example of a coin pyramid with 10 coins in the first row:

				<latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.35]
\foreach \i in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
{ \draw[fill] (\i,0)   circle (.45); }
\foreach \i in {2.5,3.5,4.5,5.5,6.5,7.5}
{\draw[fill] (\i,1)   circle (.45);}
\foreach \i in {5,6} {\draw[fill] (\i,2)   circle (.45);}
\end{tikzpicture}
				</latex-image>
			</image>



Let <m>a_n</m> be the number of coin pyramids with <m>n</m> coins in the first row. We have <m>a_1=1</m> and <m>a_2=2</m>.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
    The sequence satisfies <m>a_n = \sum_{j=1}^n (n-j) a_j +1</m> for <m>n \geq 1</m>. Give a combinatorial proof of this recurrence. Note that this formula also holds for n=1 (which makes life easier for us)

					</p>

				<li>

   List all the coin pyramids for <m>n=1,2,3,4.</m> (You can figure out how many there are using the recurrence.)

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
    Let <m>A(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n</m>,  the ordinary generating function for coin pyramids. Starting with the recursion above, find a simple closed formula for <m>A(x)</m>.

 A group of  people decide to play a game called "Night of the Zombie King." The people are split into a team of zombies and a team of humans. The people are considered distinct, but there are only 4 types of roles in the game.
			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
 A team of <m>n \geq 1</m> zombies consists of one Zombie King and <m>n-1</m> regular zombies. You cannot have a zombie team of size 0. Let <m>z_n</m> be the number of ways to create a zombie team from <m>n</m> people (so <m>z_0=0</m>). Let <m>Z(x)</m> be the <em>exponential generating function</em> for creating a zombie team. What is the formula for <m>Z(x)</m>?

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 A human team of <m>n</m> people is partitioned into two subsets: militia and townsfolk. It is possible for the human team to have 0 members. It is also possible for all humans to be militia and none to be townsfolk, or vice versa. Let <m>h_n</m> be the number of ways to create a human team starting with <m>n</m> people (so <m>h_0=1</m>). Let <m>H(x)</m> be the <em>exponential generating function</em> for creating a human team. What is the formula for <m>H(x)</m>?

				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>g_n</m> be the number of ways to split <m>n</m> people into teams of zombies and humans. We are allowed to take any subset of the people to be on the zombie team. Use parts (a) and (b) to find a simple expression for the exponential generating function <m>G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} g_n \frac{x^n}{n!}</m>.
