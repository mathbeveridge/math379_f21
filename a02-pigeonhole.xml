Suppose that we have 19 points <m>(x,y)</m> in the unit square <m>[0,1] \times [0,1]</m>. In other words, <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1</m>. Prove that there are three points that create a triangle <m>T</m> with area at most <m>1/18</m>.

Consider a function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> where <m>|A| &gt; |B|</m>. What conclusion can you draw by applying the pigeonhole principle? Be as specific as possible.

			<statement>
				<p>
Suppose that we have  5 points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> with integer coordinates. This means that both the <m>x</m>-coordinate and the <m>y</m>-coordinate are integers. Prove that the midpoint of the segment joining some pair of points also has integer coordinates. (Hint: this is a pigeonhole problem. The five "pigeons" are the points. What are the four "pigeonholes?" )

			<statement>
				<p>
Let <m>A</m> be a set of six positive integers, each of which is less than 13. Show that there must be two distinct subsets <m>B,C \subset A</m> whose elements, when added up, give the same sum.

For example, if <m>A = \{ 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 \}</m> then the subsets <m>B= \{ 1, 4, 10 \}</m> and <m>C=\{ 3, 12 \}</m> do the trick: summing each of their elements gives 15.

(Hint: what is the maximum possible sum of a subset of <m>A</m>? What is the minimum? Use these numbers to get an upper bound on the number of pigeonholes.)
