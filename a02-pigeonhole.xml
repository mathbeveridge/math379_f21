 Suppose that six distinct integers are chosen from <m>[10] = \{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10 \}</m>. Must there be two whose sum is 11? Explain.

<solution>
<p>
Yes. Create five boxes with labels <m>1,10</m>, <m>2,9</m>, <m>3,8</m>, <m>4,7</m>, <m>5,6</m>. We have six balls whose labels are chosen from <m>[10]</m>. We place an element <m>k</m> in the box whose label includes <m>k</m>. Some  box must receive two balls, and their sum is 11.

 Suppose that five distinct integers are chosen from <m>[9] = \{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9  \}</m>. Must there be two whose sum is 10? Explain.

<solution>
<p>
No. Choose the numbers <m>1,2,3,4,5</m>. The sum of two elements is at most 9.

			<statement>
				<p>
There 28 students enrolled in a combinatorics course. What is the largest number of these students that you can guarantee are  born in the same month?

<solution>
<p>
We have 12 pigeonholes (months) and 28 pigeons (students). The generalized pigeonhole principle guarantees that some month contains <m>\lceil 28/12 \rceil =  3</m> birthdays.

			<title>Fewest Chairs at a Table</title>

			<statement>
				<p>
A conference room contains 8 tables and 99 chairs. What is the smallest possible number of chairs at a table having the most chairs?

<solution>
<p>
In this case, the pigeonholes are the tables and the pigeons are chairs. Some table must get
<m>\lceil 99/8 \rceil = 13</m> chairs by the generalized pigeonhole principle.

			<title>A Small Triangle</title>
			<idx><h>A Small Triangle</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Suppose that we have 19 points <m>(x,y)</m> in the unit square <m>[0,1] \times [0,1]</m>. In other words, <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1</m>. Prove that there are three points that create a triangle <m>T</m> with area at most <m>1/18</m>.

<solution>
<p>
Partition the unit square into nine <m>1/3 \times 1/3</m> squares. By the pigeonhole principle, one of these 9 squares must get at least 3 points.
We claim that  triangle <m>T</m> has area at most <m>1/18</m>, which is one half of the area of the <m>1/3 \times 1/3</m> square. (Note: we consider 3 colinear points as creating a degenerate triangle with area 0.)

One way to see this is to draw horizontal lines at the uppermost and lowermost points of <m>T</m>. Then draw vertical lines at the leftmost and rightmost points in <m>T</m>. These 4 lines create a rectangle <m>A</m> that has twice the area of <m>T</m>. Furthermore, this rectangle <m>A</m> is inside the <m>1/3 \times 1/3</m> square. Therefore, the area of <m>T</m> is at most <m>1/18</m>.

			<statement>
				<p>
Consider a function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> where <m>|A| &gt; |B|</m>. What conclusion can you draw by applying the pigeonhole principle? Be as specific as possible.



<solution>
<p>
Such a function cannot be injective. Here, the elements of <m>A</m> are the balls and the elements of <m>B</m> are the boxes. Some box must receive more than one ball.

			<title>Integer-Valued Midpoint</title>
			<idx><h>Integer-Valued Midpoint</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Suppose that we have  5 points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> with integer coordinates. This means that both the <m>x</m>-coordinate and the <m>y</m>-coordinate are integers. Prove that the midpoint of the segment joining some pair of points also has integer coordinates. (Hint: this is a pigeonhole problem. The five "pigeons" are the points. What are the four "pigeonholes?" )


<solution>
<p>
Categorize points by the parity of their coordinates: (even, even), (even, odd), (odd, even) or (odd, odd). Since we have 5 points, there must be two points of the same type. The midpoint
<me>
\left(
\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}
\right)
</me>
of two points <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> of the same type also has integer coordinates.

			<title>More Sums of Subsets</title>

			<statement>
				<p>
Let <m>A</m> be a set of six positive integers, each of which is less than 13. Show that there must be two distinct subsets <m>B,C \subset A</m> whose elements, when added up, give the same sum.

For example, if <m>A = \{ 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 \}</m> then the subsets <m>B= \{ 1, 4, 10 \}</m> and <m>C=\{ 3, 12 \}</m> do the trick: summing each of their elements gives 15.

(Hint: what is the maximum possible sum of a subset of <m>A</m>? What is the minimum? Use these numbers to get an upper bound on the number of pigeonholes.)


<solution>
<p>
The minimum sum is 0 (for the empty set) and the maximum sum is
<m>7+8+9+10+11+12= 57</m>. We place each set into a "pigeonhole" labeled by the sum of its elements. A set of size 6 has <m>2^6=64</m> different subsets. So two sets must be placed in the same pigeonhole.
