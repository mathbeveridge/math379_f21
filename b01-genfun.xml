	<title>Generating Function Introduction</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>

Let
<me>
a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n, \ldots
</me>
be  an infinite sequence.

			</p><p>

The <em>generating function</em> <m>F(x)</m> for this sequence is
<me>
F(x) =  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n.
</me>
We  also refer to <m>F(x)</m> as the <em>ordinary generating function (OGF)</em> for the sequence.

			</p><p>

The <em>exponential generating function (EGF)</em> <m>G(x)</m> for this sequence is
<me>
G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \frac{x^n}{n!}.
</me>

			</p><p>

Both OGFs and EGFs are useful counting tools. It will take us a few days to develop enough results to be able to talk about when to use OGFs and when to use EGFs. For now, our  goal is to get comfortable with these definitions, and to practice solving recurrences.

				<li>
					<p>
 For <m>n \geq 0</m>, let <m>a_n</m> be the number of ways to pay <m>n</m>  cents using nickels. Write out the first 6 <em>nonzero</em> terms of the generating function
<me>
A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3x^3 + \cdots
</me>


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 For <m>n \geq 0</m>, let <m>b_n</m> be the number of ways to pay <m>n</m> cents using dimes. Write out the first 6 <em>nonzero</em> terms of the generating function
<me>
B(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3x^3 + \cdots
</me>


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 For <m>n \geq 0</m>, let <m>c_n</m> be the number of ways to pay <m>n</m> cents using quarters. Write out the first 6 <em>nonzero</em> terms of the generating function
<me>
C(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3x^3 + \cdots
</me>


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 You should recognize <m>A(x), B(x), C(x)</m> as variants of a well known Taylor series. What are these functions? What restrictions must we place on <m>x</m>?


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Using the product and addition principles, we can show that the  function <m>D(x)= A(x)B(x)C(x)</m>
is the generating function for the number of ways to pay <m>n</m> cents using nickels, dimes, and/or quarters. Use your answer in question 4 to find the formula for <m>D(x)</m>. (The same restrictions on <m>x</m> apply here.)



					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 The Taylor series for <m>D(x)</m> starts as
<me>
D(x) = 1 + x^5 + 2x^{10} + 3 x^{20} + 4x^{25} + 5x^{30} + 6x^{35} + 7 x^{40} + 8x^{45} +
\cdots
</me>
Verify this gives the right answer for <m>n=35</m> by listing the number of ways to pay <m>35</m> cents using nickels, dimes and/or quarters.
