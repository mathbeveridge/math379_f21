			<statement>
				<p>
Suppose that <m>A</m> is a <em>finite</em> set and that we have a surjection <m>g: A \rightarrow A</m>. Prove that <m>g</m> must be a bijection. (The key is that <m>g</m> maps <m>A</m> to itself!).

<solution>
<p>
Let <m>f(A)</m> be the image of this mapping. For any function, we always have <m>|f(A)| \leq |f(A)|</m>. We know that <m>g: A \rightarrow A</m> is a surjection.  This means that <m>|f(A)| = |A|</m> but this can only happen if <m>f</m> is an injection. Therefore <m>f</m> is both surjective and injective, so it is a bijection.

Let <m>q=q_1q_2 \cdots q_n</m> be an <m>n</m>-permutation written in one-line notation. We say that <m>k</m> is a <em>left-to-right maximum</em> if <m>q_k &gt; q_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i &lt; k</m>. Circle all of the left-to-right maxima in the following permutation. How many are there?

			<title>The Transition Lemma</title>
			<idx><h>The Transition Lemma</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Here is the <em>Transition Lemma</em>:


			</p><p>

Let <m>f: S_n \rightarrow S_n</m> be the mapping that takes a permutation <m>p</m> in canoncical cycle notation and removes all of the parentheses to create a permutation <m>f(p)</m> in one-line notation. Then the mapping <m>f</m> is a bijection.

			</p><p>

Prove the Transition Lemma. By problem 1, you only need to show that <m>f</m> is <em>surjective.</em> Given a permutation <m>q</m> written in one-line notation, you must find a permutation <m>p</m> written in canonical cycle notation such that <m>f(p)=q</m>. How can you use problem 2 to help in this effort?


<solution>
<p>
Our function <m>f: S_n \rightarrow S_n</m> will take a permutation in one-line notation to a permutation in canonical cycle notation. We do this by starting a new cycle every time that we encounter a left-to-right maximum.

If is easy to see that <m>f</m> is surjective. Given a permutation <m>q</m> in canonical cycle notation, just erase the parentheses! This gives you a permutation <m>p</m> in one-line notation such that <m>f(p)=q</m>.

			<statement>
				<p>
The Transition Lemma is particularly amazing because it can turn an <em>interesting but hard</em> counting problem into a <em>easy or straight-forward</em> counting problem. Here are two examples

			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
 How many <m>n</m>-permutations are there with <m>k</m> left-to-right maxima?


<solution>
<p>

By the transition lemma, each left-to-right maximum in one-line notation corresponds to the beginning of a new cycle in canonical cycle notation. Therefore the number of <m>n</m>-permutations with <m>k</m> left-to-right maxima is the same as the number of permutations with <m>k</m> cycles. This  number is <m>c(n,k)</m>, the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.

</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Pick an  <m>n</m>-permutation at random from <m>S_n</m>. What is the probability that the cycle containing element <m>n</m> has length <m>k</m>? What is the probability that the cycle containing element <m>i</m> has length <m>k</m>?


<solution>
<p>

Using the transition mapping, we get a permutation in one-line notation with element <m>n</m> in position <m>n-k+1</m>. The total number of permutations with <m>n</m> in that position is <m>(n-1)!</m>. So the probability that a random permutation has element <m>n</m> in position <m>n-k+1</m> is
<me>
\frac{(n-1)!}{n!} = \frac{1}{n}.
</me>
By the transition lemma, this is also equal to the probability that element <m>n</m> is in a <m>k</m>-cycle.

			<title>Average Number of Fixed Points of a Permutation</title>
			<idx><h>Average Number of Fixed Points of a Permutation</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
A fixed point of a permutation <m>f</m> is an element <m>i</m> such that <m>f(i)=i</m>. Use problem 4(b) to prove that the average number of fixed points of a permutation is 1 by finishing the following proof by strong induction.



		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 <em> Base Case:</em> When <m>n=1</m>, there is exactly one permutation: <m>(1)</m>. This permutation has one fixed point.



			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 <em> Inductive Hypothesis:</em> Assume that if <m>1&lt;k&lt;n</m>, then the average number of fixed points in a <m>k</m>-permutation is <m>1</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 <em> Consider <m>n</m>:</em> We consider the set <m>S_n</m> of all <m>n</m>-permutations. Partition <m>S_n</m> into sets <m>A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n</m> where <m>A_i</m> consists of all permutations where element <m>n</m> is in an <m>i</m>-cycle.

			</p><p>

<em>Now you must count the average number of fixed points in each of the <m>A_i</m> for the following cases:</em>



		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Case <m>i=1</m>.

<solution>
<p>
In this case, <m>n</m> is a fixed point. The remaining elements form an <m>(n-1)</m>-permutation. By induction, the average number of fixed points in the remaining elements is 1. Overall, there are 2 fixed points on average in the set <m>A_1</m>.
</p>
</solution>

			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Case <m>2 \leq i \leq n-1</m>.

<solution>
<p>
In this case, there are no fixed points among the <m>i</m> elements in the cycle containing element <m>n</m>. By induction, there is one fixed point on average in the remaining <m>(n-i)</m> elements.
</p>
</solution>

			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Case <m>i=n</m>.

<solution>
<p>
In this case, all the elements are in one big cycle of length <m>n</m>. Therefore, there are no fixed points.
</p>
</solution>

			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

			</p><p>

<em>Now use your results above to find the average number of fixed points.</em>

<solution>
<p>
By the previous question, we have <m>|A_i|=(n-1)!</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>. Therefore, the average number of fixed points among all <m>n</m>-permutations is
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
&amp;&amp; \frac{2 \cdot |A_1| + 1 \cdot |A_2| + 1 \cdot |A_3| + \cdots 1 \cdot |A_{n-1}| + 0 \cdot |A_n| }{n!} \\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{n \cdot (n-1)!}{n!} = 1.
\end{array}
</me>
</p>
</solution>
