	<title>Graph Automorphisms and Graph Labelings</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>





For each graph <m>G</m>, determine either

			</p><p>

<m>\bullet \,\,\, |\mathrm{Aut}(G)|</m>, the number of the automorphisms of <m>G</m>, or

			</p><p>

<m>\bullet \,\,\, \ell(G)</m>, the number of distinct labelings of <m>G</m>.

			</p><p>

Explain how you found this number. Once you have determined one of these numbers, you can find the other using the formula
<me>
|\mathrm{Aut}(G)| \cdot \ell(G) = n!
</me>
where <m>n = |V(G)|</m>.
