Given a permutation <m>p=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n</m>. For <m>1 \leq i \leq n-1</m>, position <m>i</m> is an <em>ascent</em> when <m>p_i &lt; p_{i+1}</m>; otherwise   position <m>i</m> is a <em>descent</em> because <m>p_i &gt; p_{i+1}</m>.

			</p><p>

An <em>ascending run</em> is a sequence of ascents. A <em>descending run</em> is a sequence of descents.

\begin{array}{rcl}
A(n,k) &amp;=&amp; \mbox{# } \,  n \mbox{-permutations with } k \mbox{ascending runs} \\

			<statement>
				<p>
In this problem you will prove the recurrence
<me>
A(n,k) = k \, A(n-1,k) + (n-k+1) A(n-1, k-1)
</me>
As you might suspect, we will "treat element <m>n</m> as special." Let  <m>\cA(n,k)</m>  denote the set of <m>n</m>-permutations with <m>k</m> ascending runs (and therefore with <m>k-1</m> descents). <em>Pro Tip #1:</em> only positions <m>1 \leq j \leq n-1</m> are considered as ascents/descents. Position <m>n</m> is handled exceptionally. <em>Pro Tip #2: </em> Be ready to think about having <m>k</m> ascending runs, or <m>k-1</m> descents, whichever is easiest!

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 As a warm-up, let's consider <m>n=4</m> and <m>k=3</m>, so that the recurrence becomes
<me>
A(4,3) = 3 A(3,3) + 2 A(3,2).
</me>
We list the 11 different permutations in  <m>\cA(4,3)</m> and all <m>6=3!</m> permutations in <m>S_3</m>. Draw a line from the 4-permutation to the 3-permutation we obtain by deleting element 4.





<me>
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
1432 &amp; 2143 &amp; 2431 &amp; 3142 &amp; 3214 &amp; 3241 &amp; 3421 &amp; 4132 &amp; 4213 &amp; 4231 &amp; 4312
\end{array}
</me>
<me>
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
123 &amp; 132 &amp; 213 &amp; 231 &amp; 312 &amp; 321 \\
\end{array}
</me>

<solution>
<p>
Here are the mappings:
<me>
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}
123 &amp; \\
132 &amp; 1432 &amp; 4132 \\
213 &amp; 2143 &amp; 4213 \\
231 &amp; 2431 &amp; 4231 \\
312 &amp; 3142 &amp; 4312 \\
321 &amp; 3214 &amp; 3241 &amp; 3421
\end{array}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

 In part (a), you only mapped to permutations in <m>\cA(3,2)</m> and <m>\cA(3,3)</m>.  Now work backwards. Given a permutation in <m>\cA(3,2)</m>, where can you place element 4 to create a permutation in <m>\cA(4,3)</m>? Now, how about when you start with a permutation in <m>\cA(3,3)</m>? Write down your observations.

<solution>
<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 For <m>p \in \cA(3,2)</m>, you can put a 4 at the beginning, or after the only ascent. Either choice creates a new ascent.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 For <m>p \in \cA(3,3)</m>, you can put a 4 at the end, or after a descent. This preserves the total number of descents.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Now we start our proof for <m>A(n,k)</m>. Given a permutation <m>p \in \cA(n,k)</m>. Let <m>p' \in S_{n-1}</m> be the permutation obtained by removing element <m>n</m>. Explain why either <m>p' \in \cA(n-1, k)</m> or <m>p' \in \cA(n-1,k-1)</m>.

<solution>
<p>
In removing element <m>n</m>, one of two things happens.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 If <m>n</m> was at the end of an ascending run of length at least 2, the number of ascending runs does not change. This includes the case where <m>n</m> was in the final position
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 If <m>n</m> was in an ascending run by itself, then the number of ascending runs goes down by one. This includes the case where <m>n</m> is in the first position.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Fixing <m>p'=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_{n-1} \in \cA(n-1,k)</m>, can we obtain an element of <m>\cA(n,k)</m> by placing element <m>n</m>...
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Before <m>p_1</m>?

<solution>
<p>
No, because this will create a new ascending run.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 After <m>p_{n-1}</m>?

<solution>
<p>
Yes: this just continues the current ascent.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Directly after a descent of <m>p'</m>?

<solution>
<p>
Yes, that descent becomes an ascent, and now there is a descent after element <m>n</m>.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Directly after an ascent of <m>p'</m>?

<solution>
<p>
No, this creates a new descent after element <m>n</m> for a total of <m>k</m> descents (instead of the required <m>k-1</m>).
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
In conclusion, how many different options do you have for inserting element <m>n</m>?

<solution>
<p>

There are <m>1 + (k-1) = k</m> possible places to put element <m>n</m> when starting with <m>p \in \cA(n-1,k)</m>.
</p>
</solution>

				<li>
					<p>
 Fixing <m>p'=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_{n-1} \in \cA(n-1,k-1)</m>, can we obtain an element of <m>\cA(n,k)</m> by placing element <m>n</m>...
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Before <m>p_1</m>?

<solution>
<p>
Yes, this adds a new descent, increasing our total number of descents from <m>k-2</m> to <m>k-1</m>.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 After <m>p_{n-1}</m>?

<solution>
<p>
No, this does not add a new descent.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Directly after a descent of <m>p'</m>?

<solution>
<p>
No, this removes a decent and adds a decent for a net gain of zero.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Directly after an ascent of <m>p'</m>?

<solution>
<p>
Yes, this adds a descent so that we now have <m>k-1</m> descents.
</p>
</solution>
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
In conclusion, how many different options do you have for inserting element <m>n</m>? <em>Pro Tip #3:</em> Remember that you are starting with <m>p' \in  \cA(n-1,k-1)</m>, so there are <m>n-2</m> total ascents/descents.

<solution>
<p>
We can insert element <m>n</m> in <m>1 + (n-2) - (k-2) = 1 + n - k = n-k+1</m> places.
</p>
</solution>

 Put together your answers from parts (d) and (e) to prove that <m></m>A(n,k) = k \, A(n-1,k) + (n-k+1) A(n-1, k-1).<m></m>

<solution>
<p>
When we remove element <m>n</m> from <m>p \in \cA(n,k)</m>, we either obtain an element of <m>\cA(n-1,k)</m> or <m>\cA(n-1,k-1).</m> By part (d), we obtain each <m>p' \in \cA(n-1,k)</m> exactly <m>k</m> times. By part (e), we obtain each <m>p' \in \cA(n-1,k-1)</m> exactly <m>n-k+1</m> times. This proves the recurrence.

			<statement>
				<p>
In this problem, you will prove the symmetry that  we observed in the Eulerian triangle:
<me>
A(n,k) = A(n, n-k+1).
</me>
Let <m>p = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n \in \cA(n,k),</m> so that <m>p</m> has <m>k-1</m> descents among <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots p_{n-1}</m>. Consider its reverse <m>\overline{p} = p_n p_{n-1} \cdots p_1</m>. By <em>tracking descents</em> (not ascending runs), explain why
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 <m>\overline{p} \in \cA(n,n-k+1)</m>, and
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 the mapping <m>p \rightarrow \overline{p}</m> is a bijection from <m>\cA(n,k)</m> to <m>\cA(n,n-k+1)</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
<em>Pro Tip #4:</em> The reversal mapping <m>p \rightarrow \overline{p}</m> is a <em>very useful tool</em> for investigating the structure of permutations.

<solution>
<p>
We show that <m>\overline{p} \in \cA(n,n-k+1)</m>.

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 <m>p</m> has <m>k-1</m> descents in positions <m>1 \leq j \leq n-1</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Therefore <m>\overline{p}</m> has <m>k-1</m> ascents in positions <m>1 \leq j \leq n-1</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Therefore <m>\overline{p}</m> has <m>(n-1)-(k-1) = n-k</m> descents in positions <m>1 \leq j \leq n-1</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Therefore <m>\overline{p} \in \cA(n,n-k+1).</m>
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

Now  it is easy to prove that the mapping involved is reversible, and hence is an invertible function. So it is a bijection between these sets.
