These two problems use composition of ordinary generating functions. Let <m>{\cal A}</m> be a task with <m>a_0=0</m> and ordinary generating function <m>A(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n x^n</m>. Let <m>{\cal B}</m> be the task "split the interval <m>[n]</m> into nonempty intervals and perform <m>{\cal A}</m> on each interval." Then the ordinary generating function for <m>{\cal B}</m> is
<me>
B(x) = \frac{1}{1-A(x)}.
</me>


			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
 Suppose that we have <m>n</m> prospective jurors, each assigned a number. We want to split the jurors into some number of intervals (the first <m>k_1</m> jurors, the next <m>k_2</m> jurors and so on).
			<ol>
\item
Use the composition result above to find the ordinary generating function <m>B(x)</m> for this process. (Hint: task <m>{\cal A}</m> is "do nothing.")

<solution>
<p>
We must have <m>a_0=0</m> (to use the theorem). For <m>n\geq 1</m>, we have <m>a_n=1</m>, since there is one way to "do nothing." So
\begin{eqnarray*}
A(x) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^n = x \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^{n-1} = x \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} x^m = \frac{x}{1-x} \\
B(x) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1-A(x)} = \frac{1}{1- \frac{x}{1-x}} = \frac{1-x}{1-2x} = 1 + \frac{x}{1-2x}
\end{eqnarray*}
</p>
</solution>

				<li>
					<p>
 Find the value of <m>b_n</m>.

<solution>
<p>
<me>
B(x) = 1 + \frac{x}{1-2x} = 1 + x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (2x)^n = 1 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^n x^{n+1} =
1 + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} 2^{m-1} x^{m}.
</me>
So <m>b_0=1</m> and <m>b_n = 2^{n-1}</m> for <m>n \geq 1</m>.
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Give a combinatorial proof of your value in (b). (Hint: if you haven't yet done so, simplify your answer in (b) to a single term.)

<solution>
<p>
Place the jurors in a line. We have to decide where to divide them. There are <m>n-1</m> spaces between jurors where we can choose to make a new interval. Each of these choices is made independently. So the product principle gives the number of ways as <m>2^{n-1}</m>.
</p>
</solution>

 Now, once we have split the people into groups, we want to do some further organization. We must choose a foreman, and then the remaining people will be designated as juror, alternate or dismissed. Find the generating function <m>B(x)</m> for the total process (splitting the pool and then assigning roles).

<solution>
<p>
For a group of size <m>n</m>, the number of ways to choose a foreman and then choose one of 3 roles for the remaining people is <m>n 3^{n-1}</m>. Once again, we must take <m>a_0=0</m>, so
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
A(x) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n 3^n x^n = 3x \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n 3^{n-1} x^{n-1} =   \frac{3x}{(1-3x)^2} \\
B(x) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1-A(x)} = \frac{1}{1- \frac{3x}{(1-3x)^2}} = \frac{(1-3x)^2}{1-9x+9x^2} = 1 + \frac{3x}{1-9x+9x^2}
\end{array}
</me>

These three problems use composition of exponential generating functions. Let <m>{\cal A}</m> be a task with <m>a_0=0</m> and exponential generating function <m>A(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \frac{x^n}{n!}</m>. Let <m>{\cal B}</m> be the task "partition <m>[n]</m> into nonempty subsets and  perform <m>{\cal A}</m> on each subset." Then the exponential generating function for <m>{\cal B}</m> is
<me>
B(x) = e^{A(x)}.
</me>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Suppose that we have <m>n</m> employees. We want to partition them into some number of nonempty subsets. Use the composition result above to find a formula for the corresponding exponential generating function <m>B(x)</m>. You should recognize this marvelous generating function.

<solution>
<p>
Once again, we remember that we must have <m>a_0=0</m> to use the theorem. Otherwise, we once again consider the "do nothing" task, which can be done in one way.
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
A(x) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = e^x -1  \\
B(x) &amp;=&amp; e^{A(x)} = e^{e^x-1}
\end{array}
</me>
This is the generating function for the Bell numbers: the total number of ways to partition a set into any number of parts. We derived this formula a few days ago, starting from the Bell recurrence. This way is <em>much</em> easier!
</p>
</solution>

 Now, each subset will become a committee, so we need to elect a chair. Give the exponential generating function <m>B(x)</m> for the entire process (partitioning and then choosing a chair for each committee.)

<solution>
<p>
Of course, we force <m>a_0=0</m>. Otherwise, <m>a_n = n</m>. So
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
A(x) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n\frac{x^n}{n!} =  x\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}
= x\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{m}}{m!}  = x e^x \\
B(x) &amp;=&amp; e^{A(x)} = e^{xe^x}
\end{array}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

 Instead of forming a committee, we want to seat each group at a circular table.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Find the exponential generating function <m>B(x)</m> for this process.

<solution>
<p>
We force <m>a_0=0</m>, and otherwise, <m>a_n = (n-1)!</m>. So
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
A(x) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (n-1)!\frac{x^n}{n!} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n} = \log \left( \frac{1}{1-x} \right)   \\
B(x) &amp;=&amp; e^{A(x)} = \exp \left( \log \left( \frac{1}{1-x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{1-x}
\end{array}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use <m>B(x)</m> to find the value of <m>b_n</m>. Be amazed at the simplicity of the answer for this complicated question!

<solution>
<p>
Remember that <m>B(x)</m> is an <em>exponential</em> generating function!
<me>
B(x)=  \frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n! \frac{x^n}{n!}
</me>
So the number of ways to split into any number of groups and then seat each group at a circular table is <m>b_n=n!</m> This is a <em>ridiculously</em> simple formula for such a complex procedure.
