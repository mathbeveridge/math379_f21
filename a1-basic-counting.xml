			<statement>
				<p>

How many arithmetic problems of the following form are possible. You must use each of the digits 1 through 9, in numerical order from left to right. You can use any combination of <m>+</m> and <m>\times</m> symbols, as long as the expression makes sense. For example, <m>1234+56789</m> and <m>12 \times 3 + 4 \times 5678 \times 9</m> and <m>123456789</m> are valid, but <m>123 \times \times 4567 + 89</m> is not.
