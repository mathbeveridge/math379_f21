<p>A group of  people decide to play a game called "Night of the Zombie King." The people are split into a team of zombies and a team of humans. The people are considered distinct, but there are only 4 types of roles in the game.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>A team of \(n \geq 1\) zombies consists of one Zombie King and \(n-1\) regular zombies. You cannot have a zombie team of size 0. Let \(z_n\) be the number of ways to create a zombie team from \(n\) people (so \(z_0=0\)). Let \(Z(x)\) be the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">exponential generating function</em> for creating a zombie team. What is the formula for \(Z(x)\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>A human team of \(n\) people is partitioned into two subsets: militia and townsfolk. It is possible for the human team to have 0 members. It is also possible for all humans to be militia and none to be townsfolk, or vice versa. Let \(h_n\) be the number of ways to create a human team starting with \(n\) people (so \(h_0=1\)). Let \(H(x)\) be the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">exponential generating function</em> for creating a human team. What is the formula for \(H(x)\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(g_n\) be the number of ways to split \(n\) people into teams of zombies and humans. We are allowed to take any subset of the people to be on the zombie team. Use parts (a) and (b) to find a simple expression for the exponential generating function \(G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} g_n \frac{x^n}{n!}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use part (c) to find a simple formula for \(g_n\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Give a combinatorial explanation for the formula in part (d).</p></li>
