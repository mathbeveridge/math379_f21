<p>American Football is played on a rectangular field between two teams. The field is 100 yards long, with a ten yard end zone at each end, each of which has a set of goalposts. The game is played with a single ball in the shape of a prolate spheroid. <div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="images/football.jpg" class="contained"></div> The offensive team tries to advance the ball down the field. While on offense (in possession of the ball), a team can score in four ways</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>kicking a field goal (3 points) by kicking the ball through the goalposts in the opposing team's end zone;</p></li>
<li><p>scoring a touchdown (6 points) by advancing the ball across the length of the field and into the opposing team's end zone;</p></li>
<li><p>scoring a touchdown plus extra point (7 points) by following up this touchdown by kicking the ball through the goalposts; and</p></li>
<li><p>scoring a touchdown plus two-point conversion (8 points) by following up this touchdown with another successful offensive scoring play.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">While on defense (not in possession of the ball), a team can score in one way:</p>
<ul class="disc"><li><p>scoring a safety (2 points) by tackling the ball carrier (on the opposing team) in his own endzone.</p></li></ul>
<p class="continuation">The game is played for sixty minutes. Use the product principle for generating functions to find a concise formula for \(F(x)\text{,}\) the generating function for the number of ways to to score \(n\) points in a football game.</p>
