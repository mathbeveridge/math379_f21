<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>Here is one story that works. Suppose there are \(n\) kids who want ice cream. There are three flavors to choose from: vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. How many possible outcomes are there? Each kid has 3 choices, so there are \(3^n\) possible outcomes. We can count this outcome in two phases. First, determine the number \(k\) of kids ordering vanilla or chocolate. (The remaining \(n-k\) get strawberry.) Next, determine which of these \(k\) kids wants vanilla and which one wants chocolate. For each \(k\text{,}\) we can choose the choco-vanilla kids in \({n \choose k}\) ways, and then determine their status in \(2^k\) ways. We must sum over \(0 \leq k \leq n\) to get all possible outcomes.</p></div></body>
