<p>Quidditch is played on an oval pitch, five hundred feet long. At each end, there are three hooped goal posts of different heights, surrounded by a scoring area. The game is played with four bewitched flying spherical balls: two Bludgers, one Quaffle and one Snitch. <div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="images/quidditch.jpg" class="contained"></div> Two teams of wizards on flying broomsticks zip around the pitch trying to score points. This can be done in two ways.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Sending the Quaffle through any of the three goal hoops in the appropriate scoring area (10 points); and</p></li>
<li><p>Capturing the Snitch (150 points).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The game ends when the Snitch is caught, or an agreement is reached between the captains of both teams. Use the product principle for generating functions to find a concise formula for \(Q(x)\text{,}\) the generating function for the number of ways to to score \(n\) points in a Quidditch game.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-12.html#li-235">in-context</a></span>
