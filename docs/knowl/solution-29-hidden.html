<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>Partition the unit square into nine \(1/3 \times 1/3\) squares. By the pigeonhole principle, one of these 9 squares must get at least 3 points. We claim that  triangle \(T\) has area at most \(1/18\text{,}\) which is one half of the area of the \(1/3 \times 1/3\) square. (Note: we consider 3 colinear points as creating a degenerate triangle with area 0.) One way to see this is to draw horizontal lines at the uppermost and lowermost points of \(T\text{.}\) Then draw vertical lines at the leftmost and rightmost points in \(T\text{.}\) These 4 lines create a rectangle \(A\) that has twice the area of \(T\text{.}\) Furthermore, this rectangle \(A\) is inside the \(1/3 \times 1/3\) square. Therefore, the area of \(T\) is at most \(1/18\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
