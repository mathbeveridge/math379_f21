<p>Suppose that we want to paint \(n\) distinct houses on a block. For simplicity, we use \([n]\) to label the houses. We paint each house with one different color, chosen from: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Our first boss says that all houses of the same color must be adjacent, and we must use the colors from left-to-right following the rainbow ordering.  How many ways can we paint the houses</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>If we do not have to use all of the colors?</p></li>
<li><p>If we must use each color at least once?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our first boss gets fired for his lack of creativity. Our second boss only requires that the "warm" colors red, orange, yellow are separate from the "cool" colors green, blue, purple. He says we should start painting with warm colors, then switch to cool colors after some number of houses (possibly 0).</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>What is the generating function \(F_1(x)\) for painting \(n\) houses with the warm colors red, orange and yellow?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the generating function \(F_2(x)\) for painting \(n\) houses with the cool colors green, blue and purple?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the generating function \(F(x)=F_1(x)F_2(x)\) for the number of ways to paint the houses to our boss's specifications?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the formula \(f_n\) for the number of ways to paint \(n\) houses to our boss's specifications??</p></li>
<li><p>Give a combinatorial argument for the answer you found in part (iv).</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>Our second boss quits to become a yoga instructor. Our third boss is tries to cut corners. Red and orange paint are cheap. He asks us to paint some <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">subset</em> of houses using the colors red and orange (these houses do NOT have to be consecutive). For the remaining houses, we are supposed to paint exactly one house in  each of the remaining 4 colors, and leave the other houses unpainted.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>What is the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">exponential</em> generating function \(G_1(x)\) for the number of ways to paint \(n\) houses using colors red and orange?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">exponential</em> generating function \(G_2(x)\) for the number of ways of painting 4 out of \(n\) houses, one yellow, one green, one blue, one purple.</p></li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Our third boss gets fired for absconding with company money. Our fourth boss tells us to just paint the houses any way we want.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>How many ways are there to paint the houses, with no restrictions?</p></li>
<li><p>How many ways are there to paint the houses if we must use each color at least once?</p></li>
