<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>We use the bijection described in problem 2. We start with a decreasing binary tree. Suppose that vertex \(k\) has a right child. We claim that there is a descent immediately after \(k\) in the corresponding permutation.  Indeed, the label of a child is always smaller that the label of the parent. So all of the vertices to the right of vertex \(k\) have labels that are smaller than \(k\text{.}\) In other words, there is a descent immediately after element \(k\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
