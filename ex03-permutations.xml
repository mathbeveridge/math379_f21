 Recall the following two definitions.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 The <em>order</em> of a permutation <m>p</m> is the smallest positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>p^k</m> is the identity.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 A permutation <m>p</m> is an <em>involution</em> if <m>p^2</m> is the identity permutation.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
Note that  the identity permutation is an involution. In fact, the identity is the only involution of order 1. The remaining involutions have order 2.

For any <m>k \geq 1</m>, let <m>g_{n,k}</m> be the the number of <m>n</m>-permutations <m>p</m> that are <em><m>k</m>-volutions</em>, meaning that that <m>p^k</m> is the identity. Let <m>h_{n,k}</m> be the number of <m>n</m>-permutations <m>p</m> of order <m>k</m>. For <m>k &gt;1</m>, we  always have <m>g_{n,k} &gt; h_{n,k}</m>, because the identity is a <m>k</m>-volution of order <m>1 &lt; k</m>.

			</p><p>

Let <m>G_k(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} g_{n,k} \frac{x^n}{n!}</m> and <m>H_k(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h_{n,k} \frac{x^n}{n!}</m> be the exponential generating functions for these sequences.
We have
<me>
G_1(x) = H_1(x) = \exp(x)
</me>
since the identity permutation is the only <m>1</m>-volution. Example 4.36 on page 202 shows that
<me>
G_2(x) = \exp \left( x + \frac{x^2}{2} \right)
</me>
and therefore
<me>
H_2(x) = \exp \left( x + \frac{x^2}{2} \right) - \exp\left( x \right)
</me>


			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Find <m>G_3(x)</m> and <m>H_3(x)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Find <m>G_4(x)</m> and <m>H_4(x)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>k \geq 1</m> and suppose that <m>p^k</m> is the identity. Explain why the order of <m>p</m>  must divide <m>k</m>. Use this fact to find a formula for <m>G_k(x)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Find  a formula for <m>H_{6}(x)</m> in terms of  <m>G_{k}(x)</m> where <m>1 \leq k \leq 6</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Find  a formula for <m>H_{30}(x)</m> in terms of  <m>G_{k}(x)</m> where <m>1 \leq k \leq 30</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
