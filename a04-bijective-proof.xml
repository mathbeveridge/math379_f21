	<title>Bijective Proof</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>








Each  problem below defines two finite sets, <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>.  Create a bijective proof to show that <m>|X|=|Y|</m>. You must
define a bijection <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m> between the two sets, and then either (1) show <m>f</m> is both injective and surjective, or (2) define a function <m>g: Y \rightarrow X</m> and show that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverse functions.

			<statement>
				<p>
For a given positive integer <m>n</m>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
  Let <m>X</m> be the collection of binary sequences <m>x=x_1x_2 \cdots x_n</m> of length <m>n</m> where each <m>x_i \in \{0,1\}</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Let <m>Y = {\mathcal{P}}([n])</m> be the power set of <m>[n]</m>, which is the set of all subsets of <m>[n]</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

<solution>
<p>
Define the mapping <m>f: X \rightarrow Y</m> as follows. For a bit string <m>x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n</m> where each <m>x_i \in \{ 0,1 \}</m>, we define
<me>
f(x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n) = \{ k \mid x_k = 1 \}.
</me>
This is a function that selects element <m>k</m> if and only if <m>x_k=1</m>.

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 <em>Well defined.</em> The output of function <m>f</m> is a subset of <m>[n]</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 <em>Injective.</em> Let <m>x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n</m> and <m>w = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_n</m>  be distinct binary words. This means that there is some <m>k</m> such that <m>x_k \neq w_k</m>. Without loss of generality, we can assume that <m>x_k=0</m> and <m>w_k=1</m>.

Let <m>A = f(x)</m> and <m>B = f(w)</m>. Then <m>k \notin A</m> while <m>k \in B</m>. So <m>A \neq B</m>.

			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 <em>Surjective.</em> Given a subset <m>S \subset [ n]</m>, define the word <m>x=x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n</m> where <m>x_k = 1</m> if and only if <m>k \in S</m>. Then <m>f(x)=S</m>.

			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

Instead of proving injective and surjective, we can show that <m>f</m> is invertible by defining its inverse function. Here is what that would look like.

Define <m>g: Y \rightarrow X</m> as
<me>
g(S) = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n  \mbox{where}  x_k = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; \mbox{if } k \in S, \\  0 &amp; \mbox{if } k \notin S. \\    \end{array} \right.
</me>
We have <m>g \circ f(x) = x</m> for every binary word <m>x</m>, and <m>f \circ g(S) = S</m> for every subset <m>S</m>.

			<idx><h><m>k</m>-sets and <m>(n-k)</m>-sets</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
For given positive integers <m>0 \leq k \leq n</m>,
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
  Let <m>X</m> be the collection of <m>k</m>-subsets of <m>[n]</m>, and
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 Let <m>Y</m> be the collection of <m>(n-k)</m>-subsets of <m>[n]</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
(The <m>k</m>-subsets of <m>[n]</m> are all the subsets of size <m>k</m>).

<solution>
<p>
This time, we will create a function <m>f: X \rightarrow Y</m> and then show that it is well defined, injective and surjective. Consider the function
<me>
f(S) = \overline{S}
</me>
that makes a <m>k</m>-set to its complement.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 This function is well defined, since the complement of a <m>k</m>-set is an <m>(n-k)</m>-set.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 The function is one-to-one. Suppose that <m>S \neq T</m>. This means that either (1)  there is an element <m>k \in S</m> such that <m>k \notin T</m>, or there is an
element <m>k \in T</m> such that <m>k \notin S</m>. The names of the sets don't matter, so we'll assume the first case holds. It is clear that <m>k \notin \overline{S} = f(S)</m> and <m>k \in \overline{T} = f(T)</m>. Therefore <m>f(S) \neq f(T)</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 The function is onto. Consider any <m>(n-k)</m>-set <m>T</m>. Then the set <m>\overline{T}</m> is a <m>k</m>-set, and <m>f(\overline{T}) = T</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>


Alternatively, we can prove that <m>f</m> is invertible. In fact, the function <m>f</m> is its own inverse function!
<me>
f \circ f(S) = f(\overline{S}) =S.
</me>
This proof is much faster than proving that <m>f</m> is bijective. But that's because we know a lot about set complements (and <m>f</m> is its own inverse!). There will be cases where proving injective and surjective is easier to explain than constructing an inverse function.

				<p>
Let <m>r,s</m> be nonnegative integers.
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Let <m>X</m> be the set of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(r,s)</m>. These paths start at <m>(0,0)</m> and join integer points via steps of unit length, moving rightward or upward.

			<li>
			<p>
 Let <m>Y</m> be the set of all <m>r</m>-subsets of <m>[r+s]</m>.

Here is a lattice path from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(6,4)</m>.

Let <m>L</m> be a lattice path from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(r,s)</m>. Define
<me>
f(L) = \{ k \mid  \mbox{the }  k\mbox{th step is a rightward step} \}.
</me>
There are <m>r</m> such steps, <m>f(L)</m> is an <m>r</m>-set chosen from <m>[r+s]</m>.
The inverse of <m>f</m> is the function  <m>g: Y \rightarrow X</m> which takes an <m>r</m>-set  <m>S</m> to the lattice path <m>L</m> whose
rightward steps occur at the indices contained in <m>S</m>. I leave the details to you.

			<title>Even Subsets and Odd Subsets</title>
			<idx><h>Even Subsets and Odd Subsets</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
For any positive integer <m>n</m>, we can partition the power set <m>\cP([n])</m> into two sets: the set <m>\cE_n</m> of even-sized subsets and the set <m>\cO_n</m> of odd-sized subsets.

			</p><p>

In this problem, you will show that <m>| \cE_n | = | \cO_n | </m> via a bijective proof.  Since <m>| \cP([n])| = 2^n</m>,  this means that <m>| \cE_n | = | \cO_n | = 2^{n-1}</m>.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 We start with a proof that only works when <m>n=2k+1</m> is odd.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 List all the subsets of <m>[3]</m>.

<solution>
<p>
<me>
\emptyset, \{1 \}, \{2\}, \{ 3 \}, \{1, 2\} , \{ 1,3 \} , \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3 \}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Pair each set with its complement. What do you notice?

<solution>
<p>
<me>
\emptyset, \{ 1,2, 3\} \qquad \{1 \} , \{2,3\} \qquad \{2 \} , \{1,3\} \qquad \{3 \} , \{1,2\}
</me>
Every odd set pairs with an even set.
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Now give a bijective proof that  when <m>n</m> is odd,  <m>| \cE_n | = | \cO_n | </m>.

<solution>
<p>
Consider the mapping <m>f: \cE_n \rightarrow \cO_n</m> given by <m>f(S) = \overline{S}</m>.


			</p><p>

When <m>n</m> is odd, an even set of size <m>2\ell</m> maps to a set of size <m>2(k -\ell) + 1</m>, which is an odd set. So the function is well defined. This function is invertible: just take the complement again.
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Now we consider the case where <m>n</m> is even.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 List all the subsets of <m>[4]</m>.

<solution>
<p>
<me>
\begin{array}{c}
\emptyset, \{1 \}, \{2\}, \{ 3 \}, \{ 4 \},  \{1, 2\} , \{ 1,3 \} , \{1,4\}, \\
\{2,3\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,4\},   \{1,2,3 \},   \{1,2,4 \}, ,   \{1,3,4 \},   \{2,3,4 \}, \{ 1,2,3,4\}
\end{array}
</me>
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Pair each set with its complement.  Why doesn't this lead to a proof of the result?

<solution>
<p>
<me>
\begin{array}{c}
\emptyset, \{1 ,2, 3, 4\} \qquad  \{1 \}, \{2,3,4 \} \qquad \{2\},   \{1,3,4 \}  \qquad \{ 3 \}, \{1,2,4 \}  \\
\{ 4 \},  \{1,2,3 \} \qquad
\{1, 2\} , \{ 3,4 \}  \qquad  \{1,3\}, \{2,4\} \qquad \{ 1, 4 \} , \{ 2, 3 \} \\
\end{array}
</me>
This time, sets are paired with another set of the same parity (even, even) or (odd, odd)
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 We now give a bijective proof that works for both even and odd <m>n</m>. Consider the following mapping <m>f : \cE_n \rightarrow \cO_n</m>. For <m>S \in \cP([n])</m>, we define
<me>
f(S) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
S \backslash \{ 1 \} &amp; \mbox{if } 1 \in S, \\
S \cup \{ 1 \} &amp; \mbox{if } 1 \notin S.
\end{array}
\right.
</me>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Explain why <m>f: \cE_n \rightarrow \cO_n</m> is well defined, meaning that an even set is always mapped to an odd set.


<solution>
<p>
We start with an even set. We either add one element or remove one element. The resulting set is odd. So this function really does map an element of <m>\cE_n</m> to an element of <m>\cO_n</m>.
</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Now prove that <m>f</m> is a bijection.


<solution>
<p>

The inverse function <m>g: \cO_n \rightarrow \cE_n</m> is defined in the same way: we either add or remove the element 1. It is straight-forward to see that <m>g \circ f = I_{\cE_n}</m> and that <m>f \circ g = I_{\cO_n}</m>.
