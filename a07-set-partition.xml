The Stirling number of second kind <m>S(n,k)</m> is the number of partitions of the set <m>[n]</m> into exactly <m>k</m> parts.

			<statement>
				<p>
Stirling numbers of the second kind satisfy the following identity
\[
S(n+1,k) = \sum_{i=0}^n { n \choose i} S(n-i, k-1).
\]
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Use the Stirling triangle we made in class to verify the identity is true for <m>n=4</m> and <m>k=3</m>. Note that <m>S(n,0)=0</m> and <m>S(n,k)=0</m> when <m>k&gt;n</m>.

				<li>
					<p>
 Give a combinatorial proof of the  identity. That is, explain why the LHS and the RHS count the exact same thing.

Consider the set <m>{\cal F}</m> of all  functions <m>f : [n] \rightarrow [k]</m>. For each subset of <m>{\cal F}</m> below, determine (i) which balls-in-boxes problem is equivalent to the subset (ii) any restrictions on <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>, and (iii) the formula for the size of the set (if we know it).

			<idx><h>Writing <m>x^n</m> as a combination of <m>(x)_k</m>'s</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In this problem, you will prove the following cool formula for <m>n \geq 0</m>:
<me>
x^n = \sum_{k=0}^n S(n,k) (x)_k.
</me>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
  Recall that the set <m>\R[x]</m> of (finite) polynomials in <m>x</m> form a vector space over <m>\R</m>.
Our typical basis for <m>\R[x]</m> is:  <m>1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^k, \ldots</m>.
Explain why (but don't prove rigorously)  another basis for <m>\R[x]</m> is: \qquad <m>1, (x)_1, (x)_2, (x)_3, \ldots, (x)_k, \ldots</m>





					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Give a combinatorial proof that
<me>
m^n = \sum_{k=0}^n S(n,k) (m)_k.
</me>
In particular, both sides count the number of ways to assign <m>n</m> students to <m>m</m> classrooms where some classrooms can be empty. Explain.


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Fixing <m>n</m>, now consider the polynomial equation
<me>
x^n -  \sum_{k=0}^n S(n,k) (x)_k= 0.
</me>
Explain why part (b) shows that this equation has an infinite number of solutions. Then conclude that  the LHS must in fact be the zero polynomial, so <m>\displaystyle{x^n = \sum_{k=0}^n S(n,k) (x)_k.}</m>
